# Maizefunge 

Maizefunge is (supposed to some day be) a befunge-like (fungeoid) 
programming language. It should be a befunge superset, and any befunge program
should work in maizefunge and produce the same output.

At the same time maizefunge should support additional features, from other
fungeoids as well as own, that'd potentially make it nicer and more 
practical to use. Also, maybe, multi-char commands?

The interpreter, written in Rust, should have a "driver" that works as a
standalone application, but should also be easily used as a library.

## Features and todos
Maizefunge borrows features from different fungeoids.
